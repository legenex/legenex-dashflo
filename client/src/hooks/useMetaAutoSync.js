// Keeps Meta ad spend fresh without anyone pressing Refresh.
//
// Spend used to go stale for hours because nothing ever triggered a sync on its
// own: the Refresh button on Overview was the only caller, and the "next
// scheduled sync" the UI displays is computed from a configured interval that
// no job actually honours.
//
// Every INTERVAL this asks the server when the last successful sync was and
// re-syncs only if that is older than INTERVAL. Reading the answer from the
// server rather than local state matters: several open tabs, or another
// operator entirely, would otherwise each fire their own sync on their own
// timer. Whoever gets there first refreshes the timestamp and the rest stand
// down.
//
// LIMITATION worth being honest about: this only runs while someone has the app
// open. Genuine round-the-clock syncing needs the scheduled job configured on
// the the backend dashboard (Functions > syncMetaSpend), which cannot be declared in
// this repo. This closes the "I opened the dashboard and the number was three
// hours stale" gap, not the overnight one.
